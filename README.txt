1) Setup the testing input (input.txt)
 - The first line is the number of elements M (integer) in the array describing the surface (Y)
 - The next M lines are the elements of the array (floats) describing the surface (Y)
 - bdef is hardcoded as 1.0 (maybe change?)
E.g.:
=====
$ cat input.txt
2 -> two elements (int)
1.1 -> float
2.2 -> float

2) Run the approriate script testing script (run_tests_<linux.sh/windows.bat>)
